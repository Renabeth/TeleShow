# Introduction
Note: This is a fork of the original repository which can be found here: https://github.com/OguzhanBesiktepe/TeleShow <br><br>
TeleShow was my senior project at Farmingdale State College. It is a web application with a ReactJS frontend and Flask backend that allows the user to browse movies & TV shows to see where they're available for viewing. It utilizes TMDB & Watchmode APIs for consolidating data.
Other features include: Ratings, Comments, Recommendations, Watchlists, Search, User Stats, and Service Filtering. We are not currently hosting TeleShow anywhere but that may change.
